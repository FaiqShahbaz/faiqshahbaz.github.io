This project combines classical CFD with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance physical system modeling.

### 1. Lid-Driven Cavity Flow

- Solves the Navierâ€“Stokes equations using finite difference methods.
- Computes the velocity field in a 2D square cavity where the top lid moves and induces flow.
- Converts the velocity field into a graph, where:
  - **Nodes** = grid points (with normalized spatial coordinates)  
  - **Node labels** = velocity magnitudes  
  - **Edges** = adjacency based on grid neighbors
- Trains a GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) to predict the velocity magnitude.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted vs error.

### 2. Pipe Potential Flow

- Solves the Laplace equation for a 2D pipe with specified inlet/outlet conditions.
- Simulates potential flow between two plates.
- Builds a graph where:
  - **Nodes** = grid points with (x, y)  
  - **Node labels** = potential value  
  - **Edges** = horizontal/vertical grid connections
- Trains a GCN to predict the potential field.
- Outputs a comparison of actual vs predicted potential and absolute error.

**Observations:**
- The numerical simulation captures vortex formation inside the cavity.
- GNN predictions follow the numerical results well, though some smoothing is observed.
- Errors concentrate near the top corners where shear layers develop.

**Observations:**
- The numerical solver produces a smooth potential field with gradients along the pipe.
- GNN surrogate approximates the field well but has discrepancies at boundary zones.
- Errors are higher near the pipe walls due to fewer training samples.

---

## Conclusion

- GNNs can approximate CFD solutions with reasonable accuracy.
- Errors peak in complex regions (shear layers and boundaries).
- Higher grid resolution improves predictions but increases training demand.
- This hybrid approach shows promise for real-time flow estimation and surrogate modeling in CFD.
