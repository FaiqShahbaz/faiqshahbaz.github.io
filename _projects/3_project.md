This project features two classic **incompressible CFD flow problems** implemented from scratch in Python using finite difference methods. These examples serve as a foundation for learning numerical methods, simulation workflow, and understanding basic flow physics.

## Included Problems

### 1. Lid-Driven Cavity Flow

- Solves the **incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations** in a 2D square domain.
- The top wall (lid) moves with constant velocity, generating vortices in the cavity.
- Implements a **pressure Poisson equation** using:
  - **Dirichlet** conditions on pressure
  - **Neumann** conditions for velocity walls
- Uses:
  - Fixed uniform grid (default: 100Ã—100)
  - Explicit time-stepping scheme
---

### 2. Channel Flow 

- Simulates **pressure-driven flow** between two parallel horizontal plates
- Periodic boundary conditions in the **streamwise direction**
- Solves the incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations using finite differences
- Includes:
  - Iterative pressure-velocity solver

## Results and Discussion

### Lid-Driven Cavity Flow

      class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
    %}
  </div>
</div>

**Observations:**
- A strong primary vortex forms in the center, driven by the top lid.
- Secondary eddies begin to form near the corners as time advances.
- The flow stabilizes after sufficient time steps, showing smooth velocity distribution.

  <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3">

      title="Centerline Velocity Profile" 
      caption="u vs y profile confirming parabolic trend" 
      class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" 
    %}
  </div>
</div>

**Observations:**
- Smoothed velocity field shows clean profile across the channel.
- Vorticity plot highlights boundary-layer effects near walls.
- Centerline velocity matches parabolic-like behavior, confirming solver accuracy.

### Conclusion

These simulations demonstrate fundamental fluid dynamics behaviors using classical numerical methods. Both cases validate the accuracy of solving the **incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations** using finite difference schemes, with meaningful **post-processing** for analysis and interpretation.
