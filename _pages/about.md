Hi, I’m **Faiq Shahbaz**, currently involved in advanced research in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** with a keen interest in integrating modern data-driven approaches like **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Machine Learning** into traditional CFD workflows. I’m passionate about using open-source software to develop practical, scalable solutions that blend classical CFD with emerging computational methods.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the **Institute of Space Technology (IST)** and am completing my MS in **Computational Science & Engineering** from **NUST**, specializing in **CFD** and **high-performance computing (HPC)**. I also serve as a **Research Associate** at the **Computational Aeronautics Lab (CAL)** at NUST.

Currently, my focus is on:
- CFD-based design and optimization of ducted wind turbines using **OpenFOAM** 
- Exploring the potential of **GNNs** in CFD modeling
- Developing custom solvers and scalable simulation tools using **Python**, **C++**, **MPI**, and **PETSc**

I enjoy solving complex fluid dynamics problems through a combination of rigorous numerical methods and innovative computational tools. Through this page, I aim to showcase my work, share open-source contributions, and connect with researchers and engineers working in **CFD**, **ML for physical systems**, and **scientific computing**. 

I’m **actively seeking PhD opportunities** and open to **collaborations with researchers** working in related domains. Feel free to reach out.
